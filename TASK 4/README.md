## What is a music recommendation system?

**Recommendation system is a filtering system, the purposee of which is to predict the ppreference that a user would give to a particular element, in our case - to a song. It is a core of huge engines that work by certain recommender algorithms and suggest a single item or a set of items to users based on such predictions.
Whether we are aware of it or not, a variety of recommendation systems have become an integral part of our daily routine since recently. Starting from accuractely target targeted advertising product suggestions and finishing with personalized video or music playlists compiled specifically for us - album recommendation engines seem to be encompassing our everyday lives from literally every corner of digital space.**

## How does a music recommendation system work?

### There are 2 most popular recommendation systems:
**1. content-based (recommendations based on the similarity of content, or, in our case - attributes of two songs).**
**2. collaborative (recommendations based on similarity of users' preferencees and using matrices with ratings for each content piece, in our case - a song).**
**The content-based approach relies on the similarity of particular items. While using a streaming music service, a user puts likes or dislikes on the songs, creating playlists. The main idea of a content-based recommendation system is to extract keywords from the description of a song that a user likes, compare them with the keywords from the other songs, and, based on this, recommend similar songs to the user.**

**In turn, a collaborative system is built on the basis of users’ overlapping preferences and ratings of songs. It assumes that if user A and user B express similar preferences, similar songs can be recommended to them, meaning that if user A likes a particular song, it is likely that this song will also appeal to user B and vice versa. Collaborative recommendation systems are generally considered more accurate, as they rely on direct user interactions with the system versus content similarity.**

**You might wonder, how does this process look from the user’s point of view?**

**As we have already mentioned, these recommendation systems do not require any additional actions on the user's side. A person simply installs the application and registers, listens to his favorite songs, makes playlists... And the more data we have about his preferences, the more accurate our song recommendations to him become. It means that as the accuracy of algorithms will grow, a user will enjoy music and will be satisfied with a music service even more.**
